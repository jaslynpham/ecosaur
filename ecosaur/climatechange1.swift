It encompasses more than just temperature rise, including sea level rise, changes in weather patterns (e.g., droughts and floods), and other environmental effects. The consequences of climate change are interconnected, affecting various sectors like agriculture, water resources, human health, and infrastructure.")
                    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                Text("Some notable impacts include rising global temperatures, accelerated sea level rise, shrinking glaciers, loss of Arctic sea ice, and increasing carbon dioxide and methane levels in the atmosphere. Climate change leads to more frequent and severe floods, heatwaves, droughts, hurricanes, and wildfires. Vulnerable groups, such as underserved communities and people with lower income, are disproportionately affected due to socioeconomic inequities.")
                    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                Text("Addressing climate change requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in new technologies and infrastructure, which can also create job opportunities and improve public health. Climate change is already affecting ecosystems, with the Arctic being particularly vulnerable, and causing shifts in species distributions and coral reef deterioration.")
                    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                Text("Water resources are impacted by climate change, leading to both increased flooding and more frequent droughts. Changes in snowpack timing affect water availability, and rising temperatures affect agriculture, food production, and human health.")

                Text("The health impacts of climate change include heat-related illnesses, waterborne diseases from flooding, and the spread of vector-borne diseases. Vulnerable populations, such as children, the elderly, and those with preexisting health conditions, are at higher risk.")
                    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                Text("Infrastructure faces challenges from extreme weather events, such as heavy rains, floods, and storms, which can stress existing structures and disrupt transportation and communication systems. Coastal infrastructure is particularly at risk due to rising sea levels and erosion.")
                    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                Text("Educating about climate change is essential, and there are initiatives like the Essential Principles of Climate Literacy and the Toolbox for Teaching Climate & Energy to help engage students and communities in climate action. With coordinated efforts and awareness, experts believe it is still possible to mitigate the most severe impacts of climate change by limiting warming and reducing emissions.")
